The 9-pin male Sub-D serial RS-232 connector (J4) is used for communications 
with a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:

PIN	DESCRIPTION
1	unused
2	RxD (data from PC to SabreMCA)
3	TxD (data to PC from SabreMCA)
4	DTR (jumpered to RTS on SabreMCA board)
5	Ground
6	no connection
7	RTS (jumpered to DTR on SabreMCA board)
8	CTS (handshake to PC from SabreMCA)
9	no connection

To function properly, the SabreMCA board requires a cable with RxD, TxD, Gnd,
RTS and CTS.  Usually, a serial RS-232 "extension cable" with a male-male 
gender changer will provide the necessary connections with off-the-shelf parts.

To communicate with the SabreMCA, single character commands are issued by the
PC.  The CTS handshake signal must be asserted before sending a command.  With
the CTS signal cleared, the SabreMCA will broadcast a character every time it 
receives a count.  The value of the count corrsponds to the channel of the count
(e.g. 1 through 254).  A value of zero indicates an underrange.  A value of 255
indicates an overrange.

HEX	DESCRIPTION
20	Version and Parameter Request--MCA will return a 22-byte string with 
	version information, followed by the one-byte settings for Scale, 
	Offset, Gain, Threshold and a parameter checksum.

21	Get ADC value.  Gets the ADC reading for Flow or Battery Level.

22	Enter calibration mode

23	Exit calibration mode

40	Set ADC channel. 0=Flow channel,  1=Battery level

60	Put serial number.  (factory use only)

80-82	Set Scale Command--MCA will set the 'binning' of the actual 1024-channel
	count to the command value minus the 0x80 offset (0-2).  A value of zero
	does no binning.  A value of 1 bins 1024 channels into 512.  A value of
	2 bins all 1024 channels into 256 channels.

A0-BF	Set Threshold Command--MCA will set the threshold to the command value 
	minus the 0xA0 offset (0-31).

C0-DF	Set Gain Command--MCA will set its Gain to the command value minus the
	0xC0 offset (0-31).

E0-FF	Set Offset Command--MCA will offset the binned channel by the command
	value minus the 0xE0 offset.  Has no effect when Scale is 2.
