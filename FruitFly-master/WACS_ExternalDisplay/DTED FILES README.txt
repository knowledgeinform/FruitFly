THE DTED FILES USED TO BE HERE, WITH FOLDERS NAMED W113 AND W114 LOCALLY IN THIS DIRECTORY.  THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM GFORGE AND THIS LOCAL DIRECTORY
TO SAVE HARDDRIVE SPACE.

THE DTEDLOADER CLASS NEEDS TO BE UDPATED TO TAKE IN A DTED FILES FOLDER LOCATION AS A CONFIG SETTING AND USE THAT LOCATION

DISPLAY WILL NOT RUN UNTIL THIS IS RESOLVED
